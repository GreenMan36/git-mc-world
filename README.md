Git-based minecraft world

This started as an idea i jokingly suggested when a minecraft server went down.

How to use
- Clone the repo
- Pull it to your computer
- Put said clone into a new folder in your minecraft saves folder. I named mine "Git minecraft server (very bad idea)", but you do you.
- Play on the world
- add all the files to the next commit, commit with a description of what you built
- Push to your repo
- Pull request!
- I'll look it over, if it's all ok, I'll merge!

This way, we have a very unoptimal but (hopefully) working multiplayer minecraft experience!
